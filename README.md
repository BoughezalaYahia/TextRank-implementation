Implementation for "TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts" paper by Rada Mihalcea and Paul Tarau
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-3252


i implemented the main idea behind TextRank Algorithm as a function and apply it on sentences (which the paper used)


ToDo list:
- customize and apply algorithm on Key extraction, summarization
- Prepare data
- Evaluate results
- Try other similarity measures other than cosine distance
